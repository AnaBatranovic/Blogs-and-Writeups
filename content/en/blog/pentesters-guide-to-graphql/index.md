GraphQL is everywhere nowadays. I often see it in my penetration testing engagements, as GraphQL offers various advantages over REST API. While it may not be a direct replacement for REST, it's certainly an evolution in API design. In contrast to REST APIs, which rely on sending data to an endpoint through HTTP requests (think `GET /item/1`), GraphQL allows clients to request specific data through queries. This means that users can only retrieve the data they need, reducing the risk of unnecessary information disclosure and therefore enhancing performance.

From a security perspective, the different approach to data retrieval in GraphQL also introduces a whole new range of vulnerabilities, in addition to classic issues that have always plagued REST APIs (you know the ones: SQLi, IDOR, Lack of Authorization, and the like). These GraphQL-specific vulnerabilities are often the result of poor implementation of GraphQL in the app itself, and can be easily fixed if you know what to look for. Despite this, almost every GraphQL application I've tested has had more than one high-risk vulnerability. As testers, it's our responsibility to ensure our clients are made aware of the security issues their applications face. This article is going to cover just that - the security issues affecting GraphQL as well as their solutions.

But before we get into the nitty gritty - what is GraphQL anyway?
